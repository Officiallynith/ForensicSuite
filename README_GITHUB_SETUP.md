# GitHub Workflows Setup for DAFF Project

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your DAFF (Digital Automation Forensic Framework) project with automated Neon database branch management. Here's what has been set up:

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/neon_workflow.yml`
**Purpose**: Automatic database branch management for pull requests

**Features**:
- Creates isolated Neon database branches for each PR
- Runs database migrations automatically
- Posts schema diff comments on PRs
- Cleans up database branches when PRs are closed
- Provides status updates in PR comments

### 2. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Purpose**: Continuous Integration pipeline

**Features**:
- **Lint and Type Check**: TypeScript validation and build verification
- **Testing**: Automated tests with PostgreSQL service
- **Security Scan**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Build Validation**: Ensures deployable artifacts
- **Preview Deployment**: PR-specific deployment status

### 3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
**Purpose**: Production deployment automation

**Features**:
- Automated deployment to production/staging
- Database migration execution
- Post-deployment smoke tests
- Deployment status reporting

### 4. `.audit-ci.json`
**Purpose**: Security audit configuration

**Features**:
- Configures npm audit thresholds
- Sets security vulnerability scanning rules

## Required GitHub Secrets

To use these workflows, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Repository Secrets
1. **`NEON_API_KEY`**: Your Neon database API key
2. **`DATABASE_URL`**: Production database connection string

### Repository Variables
1. **`NEON_PROJECT_ID`**: Your Neon project identifier

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add the required secrets and variables

### Getting Neon Credentials

1. **Neon API Key**:
   - Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
   - Navigate to Account Settings → API Keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy and add as `NEON_API_KEY` secret

2. **Neon Project ID**:
   - In Neon Console, go to your project dashboard
   - Copy the Project ID from the connection details
   - Add as `NEON_PROJECT_ID` variable

3. **Database URL**:
   - Get the production database connection string from Neon
   - Add as `DATABASE_URL` secret

## Workflow Triggers

### Neon Branch Management (`neon_workflow.yml`)
- **Triggers**: PR opened, reopened, synchronized, closed
- **Actions**: Creates/deletes database branches, runs migrations

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main/develop
- **Actions**: Tests, builds, security scans

### Deployment (`deploy.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main, manual workflow dispatch
- **Actions**: Deploys to production/staging

## Benefits

### 1. **Isolated Testing**
Each PR gets its own database branch, preventing test interference

### 2. **Automated Migrations**
Database schema changes are automatically applied and tested

### 3. **Security Monitoring**
Continuous dependency vulnerability scanning

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
Automated type checking, linting, and testing

### 5. **Deployment Safety**
Controlled production deployments with validation

## Using the Workflows

### For Pull Requests
1. Create a PR → Database branch automatically created
2. Make changes → Migrations run automatically
3. Review schema diff in PR comments
4. Merge PR → Database branch cleaned up

### For Deployments
1. Push to main → Automatic production deployment
2. Or use manual deployment via GitHub Actions UI

### For Development
1. All PRs automatically tested
2. Security vulnerabilities flagged
3. Build artifacts validated

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### GitHub Actions Tab
- Monitor workflow runs
- View deployment status
- Check test results

### PR Comments
- Database branch status
- Schema changes
- Deployment updates

### Email Notifications
- Workflow failures
- Security alerts
- Deployment confirmations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured
2. **Neon API Limits**: Check API rate limits if workflows fail
3. **Database Permissions**: Verify database user has required privileges
4. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility

### Debug Steps

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify secret configuration
3. Test database connectivity manually
4. Review Neon Console for branch status

## Next Steps

1. **Set up the required secrets** in your GitHub repository
2. **Test the workflow** by creating a test PR
3. **Customize workflows** as needed for your specific requirements
4. **Add additional tests** to the CI pipeline
5. **Configure deployment environments** for staging/production

This setup provides a robust foundation for developing and deploying your DAFF forensic framework with proper database management and testing automation.
