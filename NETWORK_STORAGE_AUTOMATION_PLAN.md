## 1. Introduction

### Current System Overview
The DAFF (Digital Automation Forensic Framework) currently operates as an AI-driven platform for comprehensive anomaly detection and digital investigation. The system handles evidence analysis, threat intelligence, and forensic reporting through manual processes that require significant human intervention.

### Current Manual Processes
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Manual packet inspection and anomaly identification
- **Storage Management:** Evidence file organization and metadata extraction
- **Threat Correlation:** Manual cross-referencing of threat intelligence data
- **Report Generation:** Semi-automated with manual review and validation
- **Evidence Processing:** Upload and initial classification require user intervention

### Need for Automation
The transition from manual to automated processes is essential for:
- **Scalability:** Handle increasing volumes of digital evidence
- **Efficiency:** Reduce processing time from hours to minutes
- **Accuracy:** Minimize human error in pattern recognition
- **24/7 Operations:** Continuous monitoring without human oversight
- **Resource Optimization:** Free up investigators for complex analysis tasks
